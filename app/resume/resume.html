    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3><span class="title">Technical Lead</span> <span class="employer">Educational Testing Service</span>. <span class="dates">2013–now</span></h3>
    <p>This job title is both relatively new and loosely defined, but over the past four years, my responsibilities have fallen into the following categories.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Front-end developer.</strong> I write most of the code for the assessment applications we develop in-house. I work on a variety of products, but all our work is single-page applications, mostly aimed at users aged 9-18. Thanks to a specialized application development framework I wrote, development time per application has dropped from months to days.</li>

      <li><strong>User interface designer</strong>. I work closely with assessment specialists, subject matter experts, and our clients to understand program needs and design accessible interfaces that help to meet those needs. I draft requirements documents, gather design ideas, wireframe and prototype solutions, and work with clients and stakeholders to build consensus around designs. This was a major part of my job in 2014 and 2015, but has gradually tapered off as our team has added talented designers.</li>

      <li><strong>Technical project manager.</strong> I develop technical requirements, scopes of work, and other technical documentation; participate in soliciting and vetting proposals from software development contractors;  help other programmers working on our products troubleshoot problems and meet their deliverables; establish software QA testing protocols; design system interoperation APIs; choose application architectures, and work with non-technical program leadership to establish realistic expectations and schedules for software development projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Have a look at <a href="#/role-detail/Programmer/">my portfolio</a> for more information about the projects I’ve worked on and my contributions to them.</p>

    <h3><span class="title">Product development lead</span>, <span class="employer">Educational Testing Service</span>. <span class="dates">2010–2013</span></h3>
    <p>I led a team that designed and built 21 engineering and technology problem-solving tasks on contract for the U.S. Department of Education. You can see examples of these tasks <a href="http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/tel_2014/#tasks/overview" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I managed the work of 7 subcontractors, a content development staff, and a small group of designers. We developed ~500 minutes of interactive assessment content.</li>
      <li>I wore a lot of hats on this project. In addition to general product-manager duties, I worked closely with the client to ensure their vision for the assessment would be realized, designed user interfaces, worked with cognitive psychologists to define measurement targets for the assessment, and trained staff that scored user responses. I also shepherded content through a multi-stage expert review process, and oversaw usability/user testing activities.</li>
      <li>The product launched on time, and tens of thousands of students took this assessment in the winter of 2013 and again in 2014. Students and teachers had overwhelmingly positivie reactions to the assessment, and our content has subsequently awarded us contracts for developing similar digital content.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><span class="title">Assessment specialist</span>, <span class="employer">Educational Testing Service</span>. <span class="dates">2007–2010</span></h3>
    <p>I wrote and reviewed test questions for language skills assessments including the SAT, Praxis, and GRE. I also compiled and maintained content guidelines for writing SAT writing questions.</p>

    <h3><span class="title">Instructor</span>, <span class="employer">Rutgers University and University of Connecticut</span>. <span class="dates">2002–2007</span></h3>
    <p>I taught expository writing and research writing courses to undergraduates, developed curriculum, and tutored at-risk students in summer programs.</p>

    <h3><span class="title">Software Developer</span>, <span class="employer">Abilene Independent School District, TX</span>. <span class="dates">1998–1999</span></h3>
    <p>I designed and maintained a small SQL Server database for district residents and wrote a web front-end in Visual Basic and ASP.</p>
