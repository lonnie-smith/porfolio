<p>Our app framework, HAL, grew organically out of component designs I worked on in 2013 and 2014 as our team began developing a new computer-based assessment platform.</p>
<p>I started by talking to stakeholders and domain experts and helping them shape initial concepts into actionable requirements. From there, I created wireframes and mockups.</p>
<p>Here’s some work I did on the design for the review screen at the end of an assessment section. The feature proposal lays out critiera, goals, and challenges; the wireframe shows one of several iterations on the design; and implementation shows the eventual result after I coded it up.</p>

<p>Lots of people needed input into the design, so a big part of my job was researching and building consensus around design choices. Here’s part of a slide deck I used to walk our client through a tricky series of choices about the “equation editor,” a tool that allows users to enter mathematical expressions and other special symbols in response to math questions.</p>

<p>Once some of the bigger user interactions were nailed down, we needed a way to more finely specify common UI widgets. In order to show both the expected behavior of components as well as their appearance, I made a style guide incorporating working examples of each widget. These examples would eventually become the core UI widgets in hal.</p>
