<!-- <p>Core feature requirements for this project included the ability to upload review content  and customize what metadata is shown on each page. We also needed to balance flexibility and uniformity: each package has its own unique needs, but the overall experience needs to be similar from package to package since reviewers might use dozens of different review sites over the course of a year.</p>
 -->
<p>Design for this project had to be done in a hurry. I spent a few days workshopping lo-fi wireframes with project stakeholders to nail down the most important aspects of layout and functionality. Some of the bigger design challenges, such as how to display complex data sets, didn’t emerge until I was in the middle of implementation, so we worked them out over the course of a few iterations on the production code. The screenshot below shows how we used color coded data, multiple tables, and additional column labels to squeeze response data into the required tabular format.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, we ran into some usability problems with the initial version of the review sites, so I added a few features to help reviewers navigate and make sense of the packages. A couple of examples are below—</p>
<ul>
  <li>The “guided tour” is a simple carousel with annotated screenshots introducing new reviewers to important features.</li>
  <li>Package assemblers can annotate any metadata field with on-demand help text. Help links are indicated with dotted green underline.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first version of the project required package authors to enter configuration data into a spreadsheet. That was a pretty cumbersome process for package authors, and it clearly wouldn’t support more complex configuration. So when it became clear that we’d be using the review sites for the long haul, I went back and built a companion app to help package authors configure packages. The screenshots below show some pieces of the finished package builder UI.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screenshot 1: the package builder app is organized as a single scrolling page, with each package creation step presented as a unit with embedded instructions. The left-hand sidebar functions both as a checklist and as a scrollspy-style navigation menu.</li>
  <li>Screenshot 2: configuring which metadata will be displayed for users and how it will look.</li>
  <li>Screenshot 3: constructing “item groups”—subsets of package content—in the same way you define smart playlists in iTunes.</li>
</ul>
