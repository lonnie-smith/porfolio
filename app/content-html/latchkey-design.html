<p>The content and interactions are pretty simple for this site, so a <strong>mobile-first responsive design</strong> made total sense. I love the roccoco, slightly stuffy flourishes in 18<sup>th</sup>-century book design, so I took the title page/frontispiece book layout as the starting point for the visual design.</p>

<p>Sketching is probably the most fun part of the design process. I don’t spend nearly enough time doing it, probably because people usually need to see something a little more finished-looking—but for me, this is when most of the acutal thinking happens. On a project like this, with no one to please but myself, it’s all I really need.</p>
