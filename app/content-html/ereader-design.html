<p>Passages for the assessment are drawn from a pretty wide variety of sources: print and online magazines, web pages, books, and other materials students might read in school. Unlike a lot of standardized assessments, which would reprint this material using a uniform (and pretty dull) layout, we needed to preserve as much of the unique character of each passage as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of the design was driven by the necessity of balancing three goals: preserving print-like multi-column page layouts, allowing users to quickly and easily move between the reading passage and associated comprehension questions, and squeezing everything onto a device with a 10.6” screen. Oh, and the design had to work well in a browser, interoperate with a larger assessment application, and be usable—with very little instruction—by users as young as 9 years old, some of whom may have very low levels of technological literacy.</p>

<p>Meeting these challenges was very much a team effort. Many of the best design ideas came from our reading assessment specialists, and we worked with anther company who ran usability tests to help us validate and refine the design. My role was gathering and organizing design requirements, and fleshing out concepts with wireframes and mockups. Functional details were hotly debated, and the wireframes below are fairly typical of my work on this project in terms of the level of elaboration that every function received.</p>
