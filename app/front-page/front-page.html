    <h1>Hi. I’m Lonnie.</h1>
    <h2>I make web apps.</h2>
  </div>
    <p>I’m a generalist with a focus on building feature-dense single page web apps using <em>Angular.js</em> and <em>Polymer</em>, but I also work on product development, design, technical writing, and linux server admin. To learn more about my work, have a look at my <a href="#/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked for Educational Testing Service since 2006, where I design and write assessment software for a national K-12 assessment. We use good design and creative thinking to make tests more valid, simpler to use, and more engaging for students.</p>
    <p>I live in Kansas City, MO with my wife and two cats. When I’m not in front of a computer, I’m reading, learning woodworking, or taking photos.</p>
