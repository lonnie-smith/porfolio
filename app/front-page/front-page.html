    <p>Right now, I’m working on several projects using <em>Angular.js</em> and <em>Polymer</em>.</p>
    <p>When I get the chance, I also enjoy working on product development, design, technical writing, and linux server admin.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked for Educational Testing Service since 2004. I got my start writing SAT questions. Now I make assessment software for kids in 4th–8th grade. We use good design and creative thinking to make assessments more fun, simpler to use, and more valid.</p>
    <p>I live in Kansas City, MO with my wife and two cats. When I’m not in front of a computer, I’m in to reading, woodworking, and taking photos.</p>
