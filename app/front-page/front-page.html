    <h1>Hi. I’m Lonnie.</h1>
    <h2>I make web apps.</h2>
  </div>
    <p>I’m a generalist with a focus on building feature-rich single page web apps using <strong>Angular.js</strong> and <strong>Polymer</strong>, but I also work on product development, design, technical writing, and linux server admin. To learn more about my work, have a look at my <a href="#/portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
    <p>I work for Educational Testing Service, where I design and write assessment software for a national K-12 assessment. We use good design and creative thinking to make tests more valid, simpler to use, and more engaging for students.</p>
    <p>I live in Kansas City, MO with my <a href="https://twitter.com/indianabooth?lang=en" target="_blank">wife</a> and two <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BGP7iYKAfdQ/" target="_blank">cats</a>. When I’m not in front of a computer, I’m reading, learning woodworking, or taking photos.</p>
